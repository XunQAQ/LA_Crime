# LA Crime Data Analysis
This project analyzes crime data in Los Angeles from 2010 to 2019. The data is obtained from the Los Angeles Open Data Portal, which provides a dataset of all crimes reported in the city of Los Angeles during this time period.

### Getting Started
To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

``` git clone https://github.com/XunQAQ/LA_Crime.git ```

The main script for this project is analysis.py, which performs the data analysis and generates visualizations of the data.

To run the script, navigate to the src directory and run the following command:

``` python analysis.py ```
This will generate a set of visualizations in the plots directory, including bar charts, heatmaps, and scatter plots.

### Data Cleaning
The crime dataset from the Los Angeles Open Data Portal contains a large number of records, many of which are incomplete or contain errors. To prepare the data for analysis, we perform a number of cleaning steps, including:

Filtering out records with missing or invalid data
Normalizing the date and time fields
Extracting the latitude and longitude from the location field
###Data Analysis
Once the data is cleaned, we can perform a variety of analyses to better understand crime trends in Los Angeles. Some of the questions we explore in this project include:

+ What are the most common types of crimes in Los Angeles?
+ How have crime rates changed over time?
+ Are there any geographical patterns in crime rates?
+ To answer these questions, we use a combination of descriptive statistics and data visualizations.
